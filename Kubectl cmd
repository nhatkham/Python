1. list all deployments across namespaces

kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces

2. List all deployments of a specified namespace

kubectl get deployments -n <namespace>

3. Scale down replica to 0 and delete deployment

kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=0 -n <namespace>
kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name> -n <namespace>
ex:

kubectl scale deployment elasticsearch --replicas=0 -n elasticsearch
kubectl delete deployment elasticsearch -n elasticsearch


4. To access the Minikube master from another host, you can use port forwarding to forward the Kubernetes API server's port to your local machine. Here's how you can do it:
  Start port forwarding with the following command:

  The error message indicates that the kubernetes service is indeed missing a selector, which is required for the kubectl port-forward command to work.
To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:
a. Open the kubernetes service definition using the following command:
   
   kubectl edit svc kubernetes
   
b. Locate the metadata section in the YAML file that opens and add a selector to the service. It should look similar to the following:
   
yaml
   metadata:
     name: kubernetes
     namespace: default
   spec:
     selector:
       k8s-app: kube-apiserver
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 443
         targetPort: 8443
   
c. Save the changes and exit the editor.
   
   kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 svc/kubernetes 8443:443
