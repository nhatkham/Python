Here are the steps to install MongoDB on Ubuntu:
1. Import the MongoDB GPG key:
   
   wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-5.0.asc | sudo apt-key add -
   
2. Add the MongoDB repository:
   
   echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)/mongodb-org/5.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-5.0.list
   
3. Update the package repository:
   
   sudo apt update
   
4. Install MongoDB:
   
   sudo apt install mongodb-org

Once MongoDB is installed, you can start the MongoDB service with:
sudo systemctl start mongod
You can also enable MongoDB to start automatically on system boot with:
sudo systemctl enable mongod
After completing these steps, MongoDB should be successfully installed on your system.

i get this errror
E: The repository 'https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/5.0 Release' is not signed.


To resolve this issue, you can manually import the GPG key and then retry the installation. Please follow these steps:
1. Import the MongoDB GPG key:
   
   wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-5.0.asc | sudo apt-key add -
   
2. Clear the package list cache:
   
   sudo apt clean
   
3. Update the package repository:
   
   sudo apt update
   
4. Retry the MongoDB installation:
   
   sudo apt install mongodb-org


After installing MongoDB, you can start the MongoDB service and keep it running in the background by following these steps:
1. Start the MongoDB service:
   
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   
2. Verify that MongoDB has started successfully. You can check the status of the service by running:
   
   sudo systemctl status mongod
   
   If MongoDB has started successfully, you should see a message indicating that the service is active (running).
3. Enable MongoDB to start automatically on system boot:
   
   sudo systemctl enable mongod
   
   Enabling the service ensures that MongoDB will start automatically whenever your system reboots.
With these steps, MongoDB should be up and running in the background, ready to accept connections.
